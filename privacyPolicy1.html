                            <p class="color-5 mb-5 fw-300">A user may view prices published on the Site (“Prices”) in their own country’s currency but all prices shown at the final checkout point of the sale are shown in US Dollars.  Depending on the currency that you use to pay for a Product, the Price you pay may fluctuate. You are also responsible for any applicable shipping, customs and/or duty fees incurred.  We are entitled to claim from you any appropriate taxes, levies or other charges of whatever nature payable on the supply of the Products in that jurisdiction. Prices, including applicable shipping fees and taxes, are subject to change.</p>


                            <h5 class="mb-3">No Warranty</h5>
                            <p class="color-5 mb-5 fw-300">All disputes arising out of or relating to any purchase you make with via this Site, any information you provide via the Site, these Terms (including the formation, performance or alleged breach), and  your use of the Site will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) then in effect at the time of the dispute. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Garden of We Do will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Garden of We Do in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings.  However, if Garden of We Do is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Garden of We Do.  If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum.  The arbitration will be conducted in the city of Perth, WA, Australia, but may proceed telephonically if the claimant so chooses.</p>

For consumers the Products come with non-excludable statutory warranties and guarantees under consumer protection legislation, such as we are the rightful owner, the Products are reasonably fit for their usual purpose, are of acceptable quality, and match any description or sample. If we breach any of these non-excludable warranties or guarantees, you are entitled, at your option, to a refund or replacement of the relevant Products, and to compensation for any reasonable foreseeable loss.  You may also have express rights of action against us under consumer protection legislation if we supplied defective Products to you that cause you injury, loss or damage.</p>
